M32VersionWidget
================
This small widget looks up the newest version of M32 Firmware files. The widget has been developed to be used on iOS devices in Scriptable.  

Installation on you iOS Device
====================
First you have to install Scriptable on your device. Just download it from the appstore at <https://apps.apple.com/de/app/scriptable/id1405459188>.  
In scriptable create a new script and import the 'X or M32 Current Firmware.js' file content into your script. Per default the script checks for the curren Firmware of the M32 Console and the current release of the software provided by them.  
  
If you want to see the firmware version permanently on your device just create a widget on your homescreen, add scriptable and choose the imported script to be executed.  

Have fun!
