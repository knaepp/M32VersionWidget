M32VersionWidget
================
This small widget looks up the newest version of M32 console firmware. The widget has been developed to be used on iOS devices using the Scriptable app.  

Installation on you iOS Device
====================
First you have to install Scriptable on your device. Just download it from the appstore at <https://apps.apple.com/de/app/scriptable/id1405459188>.  
  
In scriptable create a new script and import the 'X or M32 Current Firmware.js' file content into your script. Per default the script checks for the curren Firmware of the M32 Console and the current release of the software provided by them. Because of the fact that X32 consoles and M32 consoles are binary compatible the firmware could be used for either consoles.
  
If you want to see the firmware version permanently on your device just create a widget on your homescreen, add scriptable and choose the imported script to be executed.  

The Widget
===========

After adding the widget to your homescreen you will get one line for the firmware release and one for the software M32-Edit.

My platform is macOS and because of that I decided to search for the most current release for that platform. Under normal circumstances Musictribe will update the software for all other supported operatingsystems pretty close to that.

Have fun!
